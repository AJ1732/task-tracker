# React Task Tracker Application

This is a task tracker application built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application allows users to create and delete tasks, helping them stay organized and manage their daily activities effectively.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Users can create new tasks by entering a task name, description, and due date. Once created, tasks are added to the task list.
- **Task Reminders**: Users can set reminders for tasks to receive notifications or alerts when the due date is approaching. This feature helps users stay on top of their tasks and ensures timely completion.
